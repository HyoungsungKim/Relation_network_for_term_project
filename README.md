# Relation network for term project

Based on [this repository](https://github.com/floodsung/LearningToCompare_FSL)

- Original repository was written python 2 and pytorch 0.3 so improved it
- Implemented ipython version for understand how it works

TODO

- Improve it
- scikit-learn ensemble learning input type : Distribution is possible?
- CNN -> ensemble -> Mean square error(Use one hot vector) is possible?
  - Ensemble is used in validation phase?
- Weight of soft voting can be decided by linear layer(Adaptive weight)?
- Search about Fully Convolution layer
- scikit-learn clustering
